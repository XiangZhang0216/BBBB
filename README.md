# BurgerBoysBigBreak
This is a school project and a test for uploading a folder to the GitHub repository.

This is a little sketch I wrote using Processing 2. It will not run in Processing 3 just saying lol.
Maybe I will update it a little bit some other day so that it works in Processing 3.

The project is right now uploaded to GitHub without any of the media files (music files, image files) included.
In order for the sketch to run, one needs to prepare some media files first:

    5 mp3 files of your choosing named 
    "Stage1.mp3", "Stage2.mp3", "Stage3.mp3", "GameCleared.mp3", and "GameOver.mp3" respectively.
    
    5 jpg files of your choosing named
    "intro.jpg", "level1.jpg", "level2.jpg", "level3.jpg", and "win.jpg" respectively.
    
    It is recommended that the dimensions of the jpg files do not exceed 1000x1000 pixels, or else the program
    will lag like crap while running.

Make sure you have processing 2 installed, rename the master folder to "BurgerBoysBigBreak".

Drag the prepared media files of your choosing into the same said folder along with the source code files.

Double click on "BurgerBoysBigBreak.pde" to open the sketch, click the circle with a play logo in it to run the sketch.


Enjoy!
