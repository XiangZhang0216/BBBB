This is a school project and a test for uploading a folder to the GitHub repository.
I do not own any of the music or photographs used in this game that were not created by me.

This is a little sketch I wrote using Processing 2. It will not run in Processing 3 just saying lol.
Maybe I will update it a little bit some other day so that it works in Processing 3.

The project is right now uploaded to GitHub without any of the media files (music files, image files) included.
In order for the sketch to run, one simply needs to add in the following files into the folder:

    1 wav file of your choosing named "BurgerBoy.wav"
    
    5 mp3 files of your choosing named 
    "A Little Story.mp3", "Sedap Malam.mp3", "Sable.mp3", "Calc.mp3", and "Somnus.mp3" respectively.
    
    5 jpg files of your choosing named
    "intro.jpg", "level1.jpg", "level2.jpg", "level3.jpg", and "win.jpg" respectively.

Enjoy!
